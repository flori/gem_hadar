# A module that provides SimpleCov-related functionality for code coverage
# analysis.
#
# This module encapsulates the setup and configuration of SimpleCov for Ruby
# projects, including initialization, formatter selection, and warning message
# handling. It integrates with the GemHadar framework to provide detailed
# coverage reporting capabilities while maintaining consistent output
# formatting and error handling.
#
# @example Initializing SimpleCov with GemHadar GemHadar::SimpleCov.start
module GemHadar::SimpleCov

  # A formatter class that generates detailed JSON coverage reports from
  # SimpleCov results.
  #
  # This class is responsible for processing code coverage data produced by
  # SimpleCov and transforming it into a structured JSON format that includes
  # both line and branch coverage statistics for individual files, as well as
  # overall project coverage metrics. It calculates various percentages and
  # counts, then writes the complete coverage data to a dedicated JSON file in
  # the coverage directory.
  #
  # @example Using the ContextFormatter to generate coverage reports
  #   formatter = GemHadar::SimpleCov::ContextFormatter.new
  #   formatter.format(simplecov_result)
  class ContextFormatter

    # The format method processes code coverage results and generates a
    # detailed JSON report.
    #
    # This method takes a SimpleCov result object and transforms its coverage
    # data into a structured format that includes both line and branch coverage
    # statistics for individual files, as well as overall project coverage
    # metrics. It calculates various percentages and counts, then writes the
    # complete coverage data to a JSON file in the coverage directory.
    #
    # @param result [ SimpleCov::Result ] the coverage result object containing files and statistics
    #
    # @return [ String ] an empty string, as the method's primary purpose is to write data to a file
